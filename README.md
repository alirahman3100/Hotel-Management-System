# Hotel-Management-System

A Hotel Management System(HMS) is a system where all the 
management of hotel will be managed eƯiciently. With the rapid growth of tourism there 
is competition between hotels to manage all the things properly and eƯiciently and 
improve their management techniques to satisfy customers. So, for managing all the 
hotels requirement we make a hotel management system which can perform diƯerent 
activities such as Booking Record, Managing Room and calculating Room Rent, 
calculating Restaurant Bill, calculating Gaming Bill, storing, and displaying Customer 
Details, generating total bill amount and generating old bill. 
For implementing this Hotel Management System, we use Python Language and for 
storing the all the data we use MySQL Database.
